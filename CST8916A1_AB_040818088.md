Real-time stock market monitoring app

Section 1: REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates
Explain how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.

Rest: You could use Rest for specific endpoints to get the info you need.
Get/Stock (To check available stocks)
Get/Stock/Sbux (To check price of specific stock, in this case starbucks)
Post/Stock (To add new stock)
Put/Stock (To update price or ticker of specific stock)
Delete/Stock (To delete specific stock)

GraphQL: You can use one specific end point and get all the info you want in one query.
Query: query {stock(ticker: "Sbux"){price, volume}}
Modifier: modifier {updatestock(ticker: "Sbux", price:150){ticker, price}}

Comparison:
Pros: For REST it would be easier to read when querying because you just look for a specific stock.
Cons: Due to not being able to combine queries you would end up over/under querying or having to do multiple commands.

Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication
Implementation: Instead of a query based system, Web sockets allows for a connection where the server can deliver updates without the need for the client to make requests for stocks or updates.
How WebSockets differ: Instead of operating with http requests, Web sockets allows for a continous connection with constand and real time updates.

Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification
Recommend which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system: REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, or a hybrid approach.
My recommendation for would be a hybrid approch using both web sockets and GraphQL. 
The blend of the two technologies allows for ease of use for users using GraphQL to mass grab the stocks they are looking for and Websockets connection allowing for constant updates without users having to do anything.
